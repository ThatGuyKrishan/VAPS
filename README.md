# VAPS (Vehicle Accident Prevention system) 

This is a project made by Aman Kumar as a part of **CBSE National Science Exhibition**
> This project is to prevent accidents.

## Integrations:

- This project is connected to a mobile application through bluetooth module.
- Bluetooth Module sends delimeter byte to the application.
- The application when recieves the delimeter byte, sends a message alert for the sleeping driver along with making a sound.
- In the application we have a firebase database that stores the coredinate of vehicle where driver is sleeping for realtime tracking.

## Android Application:

> This project was made by me when I was in class 10 hence I was not aware of android development so I used MIT App Inventor 2.

**Hence I can't provide you the source code of android app.**
